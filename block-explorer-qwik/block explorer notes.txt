Implement block explorer as web app
	port 9999
	Optionally, it may hold faucet app functionality inside it

Block explorer functionality:
	view blocks,		(( DONE ))
	view confirmed transactions, (( DONE ))
	view pending transactions, (( DONE ))
	view accounts & balances, (( DONE ))
	view peers "view peers map", (( DONE ?????? ))
	view network difficulty, (( DONE ))

some routes to cover: address/:address/balance, address/:address/transactions, /balances (all) 	(( DONE ))
	:address == :account
	:address/transactions could be accessible from Transactions page



blockchain info / balances (all balances)
OR
addresses (all balances of all addresses i.e. all balances),
	blockchain info can link to this page (( DONE ))

addresses / [address] (lookup address balance)
addresses / [address] / transactions



Make data cross-link to other routes:
TODO: Add links where I can: (( DONE ))
	Transactions:
		Addresses: link to address lookup for this address
			{from, to}
		block index: link to that block page
			{minedInBlockIndex}

	Block:
		minedBy: Address: link to the address page

		click each transactionDataHash to go to that transaction lookup page


Other links:
	Block:	
		(index: could link to the same page... probably not.)
		
		(prevBlockHash: link to the block? Look up block by hash?)
