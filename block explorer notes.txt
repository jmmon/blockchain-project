Implement block explorer as web app
	port 9999
	Optionally, it may hold faucet app functionality inside it

Block explorer functionality:
	view blocks,		(( DONE ))
	view confirmed transactions, (( DONE ))
	view pending transactions, (( DONE ))
	view accounts & balances,
	view peers "view peers map",
	view network difficulty,

some routes to cover: address/:address/balance, address/:address/transactions, /balances (all)
	:address == :account
	:address/transactions could be accessible from Transactions page



blockchain info / balances (all balances)
OR
addresses (all balances of all addresses i.e. all balances),
	blockchain info can link to this page

addresses / [address] (lookup address balance)
addresses / [address] / transactions



TODO: Make data cross-link to other routes, i.e.:
	transaction lookup: 
		click the minedInBlockIndex to go to the blocks/{id} page
	Block ID lookup: 
		click each transaction (or transactionDataHash) to go to that transaction lookup page
	address lookup: 
		click the addresses (from or to) in the transaction; or clikc the address in the block (the miner address) to pull up the address info
