Consider the following:

Node + wallet + miners:
	Run & test the node
		all REST endpoints
	run & test the wallet
		create new wallet, 
		open existing wallet,
		Send transactions (valid and invalid)
		check balances
	Run & test miner
		Ensure it works correctly & produces valid chain blocks
		Run several miners & ensure they behave correctly

Node peers:
	Example scenario:
		Run 4 node
		Connect them in two separate networks (2x2)
		Mine in the first node, 
		mine in the last node,
		connect two separate networks, 
			check how the higher difficulty chain wins the consensus and the other nodes lose their chain

Faucet + Explorer:
	Run & test faucet
		test faucet, send coins to certain address
		try being greedy, the faucet should reject you
	Block explorer
		explore blocks, mined transactions, pending transactions,
		explore accounts and  balances
		Explore peers (view peers, connect to different peers)
	Implement automated testing for node + other components
		unit tests + integration tests + system tests
