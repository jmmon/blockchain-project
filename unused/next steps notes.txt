TODO: 
	- TEST more routes! Test whole functionality. 
		- Two nodes, two miners!
	- Still need to build chain sync functions, validate functions 
		- depends on the keys aspect so maybe need to start a wallet. 
			- My own? based on the homework code
	- Can still test all that I have already done though!
	
	- After I do wallet, I'll do the faucet
	- And the block explorer can be done but is easier to test after wallets (keys and signatures) is implemented
	- extra: could have them auto-connect with some sort of lookup?
		- (or just auto connect to "a known node" or list of nodes to get started)
		
	- (EXTRA) Do a better EMA for dgw??
