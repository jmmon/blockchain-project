Faucet app:
Takes parameters: 
	Your blockchain address
	Node URL
	Captcha

Sends transaction:
	We sent {coins} coins to address {link to address:{address}}.
	{link to tx: {tx}}
	Back button, donate button to send coins back

faucet works like a wallet with a hard-coded private key
	sends 1 coin (or less, input box for request amount?) to anyone who requests coins
		limits: one request per address per hour, with captcha
	For each request, faucet creates transaction (signs and sends it to specified node url thru POST request)
