TODO:

Wallet: Recover:
	Should check the mnemonic to be sure it is a list of words, 12-24 multiples of 3

October 8th:
			Testing Peers:
				Run 4 nodes: 5555-5558
				Connect them in two separate networks (5555+5556, 5557+5558)
				Mine in the first node, and in the last node
				connect the two separate networks ?? (just add peer?)
					Check how the higher difficulty chain wins the consensus and the other nodes lose their chain

			Testing Faucet + Explorer:
				Run + Test the Faucet
					make sure it works;
					try to be greedy, it should reject you
				Block explorer:
					Explore blocks, mined transactions, pending transactions, accounts & balances, peers (view peers / connect to different peers)
				Node + other components:
					Unit tests + integration tests + system tests (extra ??)











Other TODOs:

Block Explorer: "Get a Block" page seems to stick in "LOADING" phase? ???

explorer:
	Add block explorer search bar?
		Input box (on header?)
		Take input and "parse?" to decide if it's: (Figure out a priority for those search terms)
			address: (40 chars, hex)
				to, from, (transactions),
				minedBy, (blocks),
			hash: (64 chars (or 1 char for genesis), hex)
				blockDataHash: 64chars: 
				blockHash: 64chars: 
				prevBlockHash: 1char || 64chars: 
				txDataHash: 64chars: 

			index / minedInBlockIndex, (blocks, transactions) (shoud be typeof Number)
			senderPubKey, (transactions) 65chars (65chars, hex)
			data, (transactions) (string?)
			dateCreated, (blocks, transactions) (parses to date?)
			senderSignature, (transaction: 64 chars, hex,  (a|b|a+b)


		Then pull up a search page showing two sections:
			Transactions, and
			Blocks?
		Whichever is first depends on what is more relevant



blockchain/node:
	segregate logic: node, transaction, block, blockchain
